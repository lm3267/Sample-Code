I submitted an archive of the project. Just unzip the archive and open the project in Eclipse.

To run my project, you need to run class called MasterControl.

When you start, you will be given a choice between File, Console or advanced (hw3 objective) input/output.
If you want File IO, type 1; if you want Console IO, type 2, if you want advanced IO, type 3.

If you choose file IO, there will be files generated in the root directory (you can create them yourself, but they need to have special names):
input.txt for the input file (put the example lines there)
output.txt for the output file (the solution will be printed in this file)
Those files are already created, they are in the root folder in the submitted archive.

If you choose console IO, you can input as many lines as you want, until you input an empty line. 
When you input an empty line, program is going to start working and output the solution to the console.

If you want advanced IO (hw3 objective), type a to add; d to delete; p to print in alphabet order; q to exit the program. Once you type in the commands, you will get instructions too.

For UML diagram I used Dia, as I didn't get how the eclipse MDT UML2 works.
